  ## Description
          
  This project is the back end for an ecommerce site. It is the creation and maintenance of a database with all of the products in their respective categories with their respective tags. This application will allow you to see, create, update, and delete items from the database. This application would be good for any person running a business in which they have to keep meticulous eye on their inventory and update it frequently.
